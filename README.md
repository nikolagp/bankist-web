# What I have learned

Aside the fundamentals of Vanilla JavaScript such as creating a nav bar using the event listeners and event targets, creating tab components and so on, I learned about Intersection observer API when we scroll down and up. Also, for performance optimization - the lazy loading.

# What issues have I faced and how I resolved them

The most challenging was Intersection observer API. Second one on the list - the events.
